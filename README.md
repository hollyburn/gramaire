# Gramaire

A library implementation of the [grimoire_css](https://github.com/persevie/grimoire-css) syntax.

I love the vibe on Grimoire, but need to use it as part of a larger project and would like to avoid touching the filesystem. With Gramaire, I get all the vibes in a completely I/O agnostic way :)
